# Capture cross-section for antiproton - matter interactions

This repository is for a Master's thesis at Aarhus University (AU), which takes place at CERN. It consists on the study of the cross-section of antiprotons and matter interaction which can be adapted for atoms, ions, Rydberg atoms or molecules. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of exotic atom formation and the behavior of antimatter in atomic systems.

### Key Features:

- **Collision Cross-Section Simulations**: Simulates antiproton-atom collisions over a range of impact parameters and initial kinetic energies.
- **Heisenberg Core Potential**: Implements the Heisenberg potential to model the interaction between electrons and the nucleus.
- **Capture and Ionization Analysis**: Determines whether the antiproton is captured and analyzes the ionization state of the electrons.
- **Generalized for Multi-Electron Systems**: Supports simulations for atoms with an arbitrary number of electrons (`e_num`).
